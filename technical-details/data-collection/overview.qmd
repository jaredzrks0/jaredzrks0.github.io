# Overview

In order to conduct this Hall of Fame analysis, we require a variety of baseball data. We need data on annual Hall of Fame voting to know who has been elected into the Hall as well as annual vote totals for all players. We also require the career and annual stats for these players to understand what stats it takes to make the Hall, but also for every other player who has played in the MLB to conduct further analyses on HOF voting trends. 

Thankfully, Baseball Reference has all of the data we need all on their website. Baseball Reference is a baseball encyclopedia for 'everything' baseball, including individual player and game stats dating back to 1871, as well as information and data on managers, teams, leagues, The Hall of Fame, in addition to many other baseball topics. With this site available, we collect our data across their webpages, as outlined below:

**List of Baseball Reference Webpages for Data Collection**:

- **Hall of Fame Ballot History** → A central hub for Hall of Fame voting records. This page provides links to sub-pages for the voting data in each specific year. These sub-pages contain voting data from across the voting methings, such as BBWA and the CBE.

  - [HOF Voting can be accesed here](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hall-of-fame-ballot-history.shtml)

- **Individual Player Statistics** → Baseball Reference provides webpages on an individual player basis for recording both annual and career stats. This central player hub provides all the links to individual player pages.

# Data Sources

## Hall of Fame Voting Data

As outlined above, the Hall of Fame ballot history hub provides central access to each of the annual voting records. Upon reaching any of these webpages, we have full access to the BBWA voting table of interest for the given year:

The dataset is tabular, with each row representing a player up for BBWA voting in the given year. Players are either **highlighted yellow representing succesful induction, marked with an 'x', representing the end of their BBWA eligibility and unsuccesful induction, or neither, representing an unsuccesful induction, but continued eligibility.**

Features include 3 metrics on the player's vote (year on ballot, number of votes, and vote%), a basic overview of their career stats, both pitching and hitting, and a handful of the previously discussed HOF metrics.

## Individual Player Statistics

Similarly to the Hall of Fame voting data, we gain access to individual player stats pages via the central player page. Once a page is accesed, the following data of interest is accesable:

**Both standard and advanced metrics are available for batters...**

**...as well as for pitchers**

Once again, the dataset is tabular, with each row representing a specific season for the player (or subset if they changed teams mid-season). However, at the bottom of each dataset, the aggregate stats for the players career are also presented.

**Awards**

Finally, in addition to batting and pitching stats, the player pages also offer data on awards/accomplishments from the player's career. This data can be seen below:

# Objectives

Our primary objective is to use Python's BeautifulSoup to scrape data on the **annual Hall of Fame voting data, as well as both the annual and career stats for all current and former Major League Baseball players.** Once data collection is completed, we will have three datasets saved:

1. A CSV file of all Hall of Fame voting data by player and year for all available years

2. A CSV file of every player to have played Major League Baseball, along with their unique MLB id, which is used for locating their individual stats

3. A pickle file, containing a dictionary with an entry for each individual player, and 2 values for each player, representing their career batting+pitching stats, and their season by season batting+pitching stats.
