# Summary

Like any project, cleaning our raw data collected in the prior step is critical to ensuring we have a dataset that can be explored and modeled to extract insights. In this section, we read in the raw scraped data, and process in the following steps:

- Reading in all the scraped data
- Looking carefully through each dataset and:
  - Ensuring data is read in properly
  - Checking for and potentially removing missing values
  - Dropping unnecessary columns that do not relate to the research questions
  - Creating new features for for analysis
  - Merging datasets together into a singular final dataset each for batters and pitchers
