title: "LLM usage log"

This page can serve as a "catch-all" for LLM use cases that donâ€™t involve content creation, such as reformatting your own ideas, commenting code that you wrote, or proofreading text, PDF summarization.

LLM tools were not used often during this project, but did have some contributions as small issues arose. Below is the way they were used:


## Writing: 

* Generated project title ideas

## Code: 

* For general information in the data collection process on using BeautifulSoup for scraping commented HTML.
* For general information on fixing/rewriting git branch after large data file pushed
* Developed a function to decode names back into utf-8
* For writing a line of code to drop/select many specific columns from DataFrames
* For formatting large markdown tables
* Helped to debug 3d plotly rendering issues
* For formatting supervised learning results into dataframes
