# Data Science Projects

Here are some of the data science projects I have worked on:

## MLB Hall of Fame Career Stats

In this project, I analyze career statistics of MLB players to predict future Hall of Fame inductees. The model uses various performance metrics and historical voting trends to make predictions.

- **Technologies used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Key Features**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, predictive modeling, visualization
