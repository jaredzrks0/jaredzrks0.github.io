# Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to the official website of **Jared Zirkes**. On this site, you'll find a collection of my data science projects, insights, and experiments, showcasing my interests within the world of machine learning and statistical modeling.

### About Me

|Jared Zirkes | |
|-|-|
|![](assets/photo_storage/about_me.jpeg){width=330, height=330}| I am a first year graduate student working toward a Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics from Georgetown University. I also completed my undergrad at Washington University in St. Louis, studing Economics and Finance.  <br/> <br/>Professionally, I spent the 3 years working in market research at **NielsenIQ**, where I helped our clients to both forecast sales for their new product launches and optimize their launch stratigies.  <br/> <br/> In my free time, I enjoy working on baseball analytics projects, creating and testing new recipes, and keeping track of all my favorite mediocre Minnesota based sports teams. |

### Projects

Below are some of the key data science projects I've worked on:

- **Baseball Hall of Fame Analysis**: A project aimed at analyzing historical BBWAA Baseball Hall of Fame voting trends, and utilizing career statistics of players to predict future Hall of Fame inductees.
- **MLB Game Simulation**: A machine learning model to simulate MLB plate appearances based on player and team data, used to simulate MLB games and player stat lines.
- **News Recommender System**: A document retrieval system designed to recommend news articles from diverse viewpoints.
