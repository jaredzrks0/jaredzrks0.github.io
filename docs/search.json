The model uses various performance metrics and historical voting trends to make predictions.\n\nTechnologies used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib\nKey Features: Data cleaning, feature engineering, predictive modeling, visualization\n\nView Project on GitHub\n\n\n\n\nThis document retrieval system is designed to recommend articles from diverse viewpoints to users based on their preferences. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to match articles with similar topics.\n\nTechnologies used: Python, NLP, Flask, Scikit-learn\nKey Features: Text similarity, machine learning, recommendation systems\n\nView Project on GitHub\n\n\n\n\nA machine learning model simulating baseball games based on player and team data. This project focuses on creating a realistic simulation by incorporating various factors such as player stats, historical performance, and game conditions.\n\nTechnologies used: Python, TensorFlow, Pandas\nKey Features: Simulations, model training, performance analysis\n\nView Project on GitHub"
